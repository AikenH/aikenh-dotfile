If u want to know how to transfer you .vimrc to .lua, read this [Everything you need to know to configure neovim using lua.](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/configuring-neovim-using-lua/).

Before using those config file, read [office doc](https://nvchad.com/docs/config/walkthrough) first, that way we only update those config in custom (unless necessary).

This dir contain(not finish yet).

- mappings add some keymap for daily use.
- init add some vim setting

If dont need to modify the core config file, I'll continue update this or I will fork the repo.
